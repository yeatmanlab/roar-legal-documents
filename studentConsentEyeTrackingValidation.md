**PURPOSE OF THE STUDY**  
Data collected through games in the web-browser will help researchers understand relationships between academic skills, reading proficiency, cognition, perception, and/or attitudes towards reading and school in individuals with a broad range of reading skills.  
   
**STUDY PROCEDURES**  
In this study, you will be asked to complete standardized assessments of reading & other academic skills, language, cognition, and perception; complete computer tasks via a computer screen; and answer questions about attitudes towards reading and school. Audio will be presented via headphones or speakers. An eye-tracking software will request access to your webcam and will be used to measure eye movements. You will be asked to provide verbal responses, in which case the web browser will request access to your computer microphone. You may be asked to complete multiple activities in one session depending on the study. 

You may complete additional achievement testing over Zoom or in-person with a member of the research staff. If you participate in this additional testing then a video and audio recording of the session will be recorded to ensure that the scores are recorded accurately.

**PRIVACY AND DATA COLLECTION**  
We will do our best to ensure your privacy. Data that is collected through this online experiment is stored separately from identifying information such as your name, but information that is required for analysis such as birth year, birth month, and grade will be stored alongside data. Each participant is assigned a code and that is used rather than names. This is called “coded data” and we try to ensure that the identity of our research participants is kept confidential. Data collected as part of this study may be used for many years to help discover trends in the population and explore changes due to development and education. In addition, coded data may be shared online or with collaborators to allow for new and unforeseen discoveries. Researchers may choose to include coded data in publications to support findings, or they may choose to release coded data alongside findings for replicability.

We will collect questionnaire responses, mouse and click data, scrolling behavior, scores earned, button presses and their timestamps, time spent on each page, audio recordings,, your IP address to look up your state and county, or other data that may be derived from your behavior on our page. This data will be stored on protected servers. The eye-tracking software will use your webcam to track your eyes. This software will record and save video data for future analysis. Once analysis has been completed, the video data will be deleted. If you are invited to partake in additional achievement testing then the video and audio recording of the session will be collected. Once analysis is complete and scores have been confirmed, the video and audio recording will be deleted. Incomplete data may be logged if you quit out of the experiment early. If you would like to void your data, you may request it through our contact email.

If you are participating in school or at home as part of a partnership between your school and the research team, then your school will also know that you participated, and activity results may be shared with your school.

**CERTIFICATE OF CONFIDENTIALITY**  
This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. The researchers with this Certificate may not disclose or use information, documents, or biospecimens that may identify you in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other action, suit, or proceeding, or be used as evidence, for example, if there is a court subpoena, unless you have consented for this use. Information, documents, or biospecimens protected by this Certificate cannot be disclosed to anyone else who is not connected with the research except, if there is a federal, state, or local law that requires disclosure (such as to report child abuse or communicable diseases but not for federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, see below); if you have consented to the disclosure, including for your medical treatment; or if it is used for other scientific research, as allowed by federal regulations protecting research subjects.

The Certificate of Confidentiality will not be used to prevent disclosure as required by federal, state, or local law of harm to self or others.

The Certificate of Confidentiality will not be used to prevent disclosure for any purpose you have consented to in this informed consent document, including sharing assessment results back with your school.

**COMPENSATION**  
Participation in this study is voluntary, and you will not receive financial compensation.

**RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT**  
If there is any reason to believe you are not safe to participate in any of the tasks, please contact us at [roar-research@stanford.edu](mailto:roar-research@stanford.edu). Some people may experience some physical discomfort or boredom due to being asked to sit for long periods. For computer tasks, some people may also experience dry eyes or eye fatigue. For some tasks that are untimed, breaks can be taken as needed during the session.

**FINANCIAL SPONSOR**   
Advanced Education Research and Development Fund (AERDF), Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund, Inc., National Institutes of Health, and the Robertson Foundation are providing financial support and/or material for this study.
