**What will happen to me in this study?**  
You are invited to participate in a research study about reading. If you decide to participate in this study:

* You will look at things like words or cartoon pictures and respond by clicking, typing, tapping, or speaking depending on the activity you play. These responses will be recorded.   
* You will be asked various questions on how you feel about reading, learning, school, and the activities you played.  
* You will complete additional activities one-on-one with a Stanford scientist. We will record your audio and video to keep track of your answers. If this makes you uncomfortable then you can ask your parent or guardian for your recordings to be deleted.

Each activity will give you specific instructions on what you need to do. Your parent or another trusted adult can help you understand the instructions for each activity if you are confused. Before you begin, you will have a chance to practice. Once the activity begins, work on your own without any help from anyone else. Sometimes the activity might feel difficult, but thatâ€™s okay. Just do the best you can\! You may be asked to complete multiple activities in one session. For activities that are not timed, feel free to take breaks in between activities.
