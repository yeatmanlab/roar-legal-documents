#### PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
Data collected through games in the web-browser will help researchers understand relationships between academic skills, reading proficiency, cognition, perception, and/or attitudes towards reading and school in individuals with a broad range of reading skills.

#### STUDY PROCEDURES
In this study, you will be asked to complete standardized assessments of reading & other academic skills, language, cognition, and perception, complete computer tasks via a computer screen, and answer questions about attitudes towards reading and school. Audio will be presented via headphones or speakers. You may be asked to complete multiple activities in one session depending on the study. 

For additional achievement testing: you may complete additional achievement testing over Zoom or in-person with a member of the research staff. If you participate in this additional testing then a video and audio recording of the session will be recorded to ensure that the scores are recorded accurately.

#### PRIVACY OR DATA COLLECTION 
We will do our best to ensure your privacy. Data that is collected through this online experiment is stored separately from identifying information such as your name, but information that is required for analysis such as birth year, birth month, and grade will be stored alongside data. Each participant is assigned a code and that is used rather than names. This is called “coded data” and we try to ensure that the identity of our research participants is kept confidential. Data collected as part of this study may be used for many years to help discover trends in the population and explore changes due to development and education. In addition, coded data may be shared online or with collaborators to allow for new and unforeseen discoveries. Researchers may choose to include coded data in publications to support findings, or they may choose to release coded data alongside findings for replicability.

We will collect questionnaire responses, mouse and click data, scrolling behavior, scores earned, button presses and their timestamps, time spent on each page, your IP address to look up your state and county, or other data that may be derived from your behavior on our page. This data will be stored on protected servers. If you are invited to partake in additional achievement testing then the video and audio recording of the session will be collected. Once analysis is complete and scores have been confirmed, the video and audio recording will be deleted. Incomplete data may be logged if you quit out of the experiment early. If you would like to void your data, you may request it through our contact email.

#### COMPENSATION
Participation in this study is voluntary and you will not receive financial compensation.

#### RISKS, STRESS, OR DISCOMFORT
If there is any reason to believe you are not safe to participate in any of the tasks, please contact us at roar-research@stanford.edu. Some people may experience some physical discomfort or boredom due to being asked to sit for long periods. For computer tasks, some people may also experience dry eyes or eye fatigue. For some tasks that are untimed, breaks can be taken as needed during the session.

#### CONTACT INFORMATION
If you have any additional questions or concerns about our research, feel free to email us at roar-research@stanford.edu. We will be more than happy to help!

For general information regarding questions or concerns about your rights as a research participant, please call 1-866-680-2906 to reach the Administrative Panel on Human Subjects in Medical Research, Stanford University.

[ ] I understand that I may complete additional 1-on-1 achievement testing at the discretion of my school/organization. I understand that in order to participate in this additional testing, the video and audio will be recorded. This data will only be used for data scoring purposes, will be stored securely, and will not be shared with others outside the lab.

[ ]  I agree to participate in this research. Participation in this research is voluntary, and I can stop at any time without penalty. I feel that I understand what I am getting into, and I know I am free to leave the experiment at any time by simply closing the web browser.
