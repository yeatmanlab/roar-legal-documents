<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Stanford University Brain Development and Education Lab: Online Study </h4>

#### DESCRIPTION 

You and your child are invited to participate in a research study. Our goal is to understand the factors that are important to reading development and to develop useful, accurate, and reliable reading assessments for schools and researchers. We appreciate your participation! 

In this study, you and your child will have opportunities to complete one or more of the following: 1) surveys for parents/guardians, 2) online activities for your child, 3) a scheduled virtual appointment for your child to complete reading assessments with a Stanford researcher. Audio may be presented via headphones or speakers. Stanford University, the State of California, the Jacobs Foundation, Microsoft, Georgia State University (GSU), and the Advanced Education Research and Development Fund (AERDF) are providing financial support and/or material for this study.

#### TIME INVOLVEMENT

There will be an estimated time shown for each individual task. You can take breaks in between.

#### RISKS AND BENEFITS
There are no significant foreseeable risks associated with this study. 
If you are signing up for this study through a partnership between Stanford and your child’s school, clinic or educational organization, then your child’s results on online activities and standardized reading assessments will be shared with the partnering organization, as additional information that can help them better support your child’s learning. Please note that parent survey responses will NOT be shared with study partners.

For partnerships with schools/districts, we will link information that we gather on your child’s skills and behaviors with demographic information and educational records that are routinely collected by your child’s school/district, and with similar information that we may have collected from previous participation.

If you are **NOT** signing up through a partnership, then you will have an opportunity to request your child’s results. By requesting results, you consent to receiving them via email. We cannot guarantee the security or confidentiality of potentially sensitive information sent via email.

#### PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS

Participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative is not to participate. 

You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions. Incomplete data may be logged if your child quits out of an activity early. If you would like to void your child’s data, you may email: readingresearch@stanford.edu.

The absolute confidentiality of data for this study is closely guarded. Your/your child’s individual privacy will be strictly maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study. In any sort of report about the study, there will be no information to identify you or your child. Identifiers might be removed from identifiable private information and, after such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to another investigator for future research studies without additional informed consent from you.

If the researchers have serious concerns about your child’s health and/or safety based on information gathered in this study, the researchers may contact you and provide a referral for care.
Please note that our online booking calendar for scheduling virtual appointments (Square) is not affiliated with Stanford, and it will ask you to enter a name, email and phone number to send appointment reminders via text and/or email. If you are not comfortable with providing this information, you are welcome to look at the calendar then contact us at readingresearch@stanford.edu with the appointment slot that you would like.

#### VIDEO RECORDING

For scheduled virtual appointments, we will video record the session so that the research team can confirm the results. The video will be stored securely and used for the sole purpose of ensuring testing accuracy. The video will not be shared outside of the research team. Video recording is not required for study participation. If you are not comfortable with the above procedures, you may choose not to sign up for a virtual appointment. 

#### COMPENSATION 

Some tasks can be completed for Tango gift cards, which can be redeemed for gift cards from various vendors or charity donations. Participants may receive up to $15 per web experiment and up to $25 an hour for virtual appointments. Specific reward amounts will be indicated on the task card and/or study invitation, which you can view before launching the task or scheduling the appointment. The Tango system is not affiliated with Stanford and will require us to input your name and email to send the electronic gift card to you. If you have questions about compensation for any activity, feel free to ask the research team to clarify.

#### CONTACT INFORMATION
If you have any questions about our research or your child’s results, please email us at readingresearch@stanford.edu.
