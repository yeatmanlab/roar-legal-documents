#### **What will happen to me in this study?**

You are invited to complete online activities. In these activities, you will look at things like words or cartoon pictures. You will respond by clicking, typing, tapping, or speaking depending on the activity you play and these responses will be recorded. Some activities may record your eye movement and video. Each activity will give you specific instructions on what you need to do. Your teacher or another trusted adult can help you understand the instructions for each activity if you are confused. Before you begin, you will have a chance to practice. Once the activity begins, work on your own without any help from anyone else. Sometimes the activity might feel difficult, but that’s okay. Just do the best you can\!

#### **Can anything bad happen to me?**

We don’t expect anything bad to happen to you.

#### **Can anything good happen to me?**
